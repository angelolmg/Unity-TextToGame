# Text-to-Game
[WIP]
A Unity based project, where you can feed it a .txt file with a dialog and it will produce a game (visual novel style) using it.
Supports multiple choice based gameplay, as a common visual novel would. 
Still requires you to provide sprites for the characters and backgrounds.

This software is based on the redbluegame's awesome Unity-text-typer at: https://github.com/redbluegames/unity-text-typer
